      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelback">Nickelback</a> is a Canadian rock band formed in 1995 in Hanna, Alberta, Canada.
      The band is composed of guitarist and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger,
      guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Ryan Peake, bassist Mike Kroeger,
      and drummer Daniel Adair. The band went through several drummer changes
